Installing from Source
======================
Source installation is based on standard GNU autotools
framework. Simply follow the example below to get started. For
advanced usage, refer to "./configure --help".

Example :
	$ ./configure --prefix="" --enable-silent-rules
	$ make
	$ make install


For Developers
==============
If you are compiling source checkout from git repository, you need to generate build script first. 

Example
       $ ./autogen.sh && ./configure --prefix=""

If you want to delete all autogenerated files from your local copy, you can perform maintainer-clean.

       $ make maintainer-clean
