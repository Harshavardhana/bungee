Installing from Source
======================
Source installation is based on standard GNU autotools
framework. Simply follow the example below to get started. For
advanced usage, refer to "./configure --help".

Example :
   $ ./configure --prefix="" --enable-silent-rules
   $ make
   $ make install


For Developers
==============
If you are compiling source checkout from git repository, you need to
generate build script first.
   $ ./autogen.sh && ./configure --prefix=""

If you want to delete all auto-generated files from your local copy,
you can perform maintainer-clean.
   $ make maintainer-clean

To compile with debug symbols
   $ ./autogen.sh && CGLAGS="-O0 -g" ./configure --prefix=/usr


Building Documentation
======================
NOTE: Regular users can download PDF or HTML documentation from the project site.
Only developers and package maintainers are required to build documentation.

Bungee documentation uses publican system (based on docbook).
Bungee brand (i.e. bungee theme package) is available in the source
repository under $(srcdir)/doc/publican-bungee/.

Before you enable building documentation with "./configure --enable-docs",
you must have installed bungee brand package. Follow instructions below.
   $ cd ./doc/publican-bungee/
   $ make
   $ sudo make install
